## Summary
This tutorial provides a simple introduction to using OODT with Docker. 
It sets up a simple system composed of one OODT File Manager (FM) and one OODT Workflow Manager (WM),
running in separate Docker containers on the same host. The FM and WM are pre-configured to run and
archive products produced by a "test-workflow" that is composed of two PGEs, each of which writes out a
test file.
